ActiveAdmin.setup do |config|

  #
  #  Add active admin pages from this engine
  # 
  config.load_paths << File.expand_path("../../../app/admin", __FILE__)

  # == User Authentication
  #
  # Active Admin will automatically call an authentication
  # method in a before filter of all controller actions to
  # ensure that there is a currently logged in admin user.
  #
  # This setting changes the method which Active Admin calls
  # within the controller.
  config.authentication_method = :authenticate_admin_user!


  # == Current User
  #
  # Active Admin will associate actions with the current
  # user performing them.
  #
  # This setting changes the method which Active Admin calls
  # to return the currently logged in user.
  config.current_user_method = :current_admin_user


  # == Logging Out
  #
  # Active Admin displays a logout link on each screen. These
  # settings configure the location and method used for the link.
  #
  # This setting changes the path where the link points to. If it's
  # a string, the strings is used as the path. If it's a Symbol, we
  # will call the method to return the path.
  #
  # Default:
  config.logout_link_path = :destroy_admin_user_session_path

  # This setting changes the http method used when rendering the
  # link. For example :get, :delete, :put, etc..
  #
  # Default:
  # config.logout_link_method = :get


  # == Admin Comments
  #
  # Admin comments allow you to add comments to any model for admin use.
  # Admin comments are enabled by default.
  #
  # Default:
  config.allow_comments = false
  #
  # You can turn them on and off for any given namespace by using a
  # namespace config block.
  #
  # Eg:
  #   config.namespace :without_comments do |without_comments|
  #     without_comments.allow_comments = false
  #   end


  # == Controller Filters
  #
  # You can add before, after and around filters to all of your
  # Active Admin resources from here.
  #
  # config.before_filter :do_something_awesome


  # == Register Stylesheets & Javascripts
  #
  # We recommend using the built in Active Admin layout and loading
  # up your own stylesheets / javascripts to customize the look
  # and feel.
  #
  # To load a stylesheet:
  config.register_stylesheet 'cmsgem/active_admin'

  #
  # You can provide an options hash for more control, which is passed along to stylesheet_link_tag():
  #   config.register_stylesheet 'my_print_stylesheet.css', :media => :print
  #
  # To load a javascript file:
  config.register_javascript 'active_admin_custom.js'
end
